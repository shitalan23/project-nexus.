I wanted to provide an update on the backend task I was assigned. As I began working on it, I realized that my current knowledge and skills in this area are not as strong as I had initially anticipated. This has made it challenging for me to complete the task within the expected timeframe.

I am eager to learn and contribute effectively, and I see this task as a valuable opportunity to develop my web development skills. To ensure that I can deliver a high-quality result, I would like to request some additional time to work on the task.

Thank you for your understanding and support. I am committed to making the most of this learning experience.
